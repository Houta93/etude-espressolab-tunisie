# Study Methodology

## General Approach and Analytical Framework

This technical and economic feasibility study adopts a **rigorous and structured methodology** to evaluate the feasibility of establishing the Espressolab franchise in Tunisia. The approach combines in-depth quantitative analyses with qualitative market assessments, adhering to international feasibility study standards.

The analysis is based on a **seven-dimensional methodological framework** covering strategic, commercial, technical, organizational, financial, and legal aspects of the project. This holistic approach ensures a comprehensive evaluation of all critical success factors.

## Information Sources and Reliability Criteria

### Source Hierarchy

Information collection follows a **strict reliability hierarchy** prioritizing official and institutional sources. Primary data comes from Tunisian government agencies (National Institute of Statistics, Central Bank of Tunisia, sectoral ministries) and recognized international institutions (World Bank, IMF, African Development Bank).

Secondary sources include sectoral studies from specialized firms (Euromonitor, Statista), reports from professional organizations (International Coffee Organization, Specialty Coffee Association), and emerging market analyses. Tertiary sources, used only for contextualization, include specialized media and commercial publications.

### Documentation System and Traceability

All information used in the study is **referenced using a superscript numbering system** (¹, ², ³, etc.) allowing complete traceability. Each source undergoes a **reliability assessment** on a 1-5 star scale, documented in Appendix E with the complete URL, consultation date, and context of use.

This approach meets the transparency requirements of financial institutions and facilitates independent verification of data by project stakeholders.

## Basic Assumptions and Analysis Foundations

### Macroeconomic Assumptions

The study is based on **prudent macroeconomic assumptions** regarding the evolution of the Tunisian economy. Projections incorporate an annual GDP growth rate of 2.5%¹, controlled inflation at 6-7%², and relative stability of the dinar/dollar exchange rate. These assumptions, validated by IMF and World Bank forecasts, form the foundation of the financial projections.

### Sectoral Assumptions

Coffee market projections are based on an **annual sectoral growth of 8.72%**³, consistent with trends observed in similar emerging countries. The evolution of consumption habits incorporates increasing urbanization (70.88% urban population)⁴ and the emergence of a middle class receptive to premium concepts.

### Operational Assumptions

Activity forecasts are based on **realistic operational assumptions**: 250 customers per day at cruising speed, average ticket of 25.00 TND, and gross margin rate of 69.1%. These parameters, calibrated on the performance of the international Espressolab network and adjusted to the specificities of the Tunisian market, ensure the robustness of the projections.

## Analysis Methods and Tools Used

### Market Analysis

The market study combines **top-down and bottom-up approaches** to size the opportunity. The top-down approach starts from the overall size of the Tunisian coffee market (923.27 million USD)⁵ to identify the addressable share for the Espressolab concept. The bottom-up approach builds forecasts from detailed analysis of the catchment area and target customer segments.

Customer segmentation uses **sociodemographic, behavioral, and psychographic criteria** to identify three priority segments: Urban Professionals, Creative Millennials, and Social Connectors. This segmentation, validated by sectoral market studies, guides positioning and commercial strategy.

### Financial Analysis

The financial evaluation applies **standard investment analysis methods**: Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), payback period, and sensitivity analysis. The 5-year projections incorporate optimistic, realistic, and pessimistic scenarios to test the robustness of the business model.

The break-even calculation uses the fixed and variable cost method, allowing identification of the minimum activity level required (167 customers/day)⁶. This analysis guides operational objectives and ramp-up strategies.

### Risk Analysis

Risk identification and assessment follow a **systemic approach** covering strategic, operational, financial, and regulatory risks. Each risk undergoes a probability and impact assessment, allowing prioritization of mitigation measures and development of contingency plans.

## Validation Process and Quality Control

### Cross-Validation of Data

All critical data undergoes **cross-validation** by at least two independent sources. Significant discrepancies trigger additional investigations and, if necessary, the adoption of conservative assumptions. This approach ensures the reliability of the analysis foundations.

### Inter-Chapter Consistency

A **consistency control system** verifies the alignment of data across all chapters of the study. Financial indicators, market assumptions, and operational parameters are systematically checked to eliminate any internal contradictions.

### External Expert Review

The main conclusions of the study benefit from a **review by sectoral experts** familiar with the Tunisian market and the coffee industry. This external validation strengthens the credibility of the analysis and identifies potential methodological biases.

## Study Limitations and Interpretation Precautions

### Temporal Limitations

The study reflects **market conditions at the time of its completion** (September 2024). The rapid evolution of Tunisia's economic and regulatory environment may affect the validity of certain conclusions. Regular updating of data is recommended, particularly for macroeconomic and regulatory aspects.

### Geographical Limitations

The analysis focuses on the **Tunis market and its region**, representing approximately 25% of the Tunisian population. Extrapolation to other regions would require additional studies taking into account local specificities in terms of purchasing power, consumption habits, and competitive environment.

### Sectoral Limitations

The study favors a **conservative approach** in evaluating the potential of the Third Wave Coffee segment in Tunisia. The absence of direct local references requires extrapolation from experiences in similar markets, introducing uncertainty about the pace of development and adoption of the concept.

## Recommendations for Using the Study

### Periodic Updates

It is recommended to **revise key assumptions** every six months, particularly macroeconomic data, competitive evolution, and consumption trends. This monitoring will allow adjustment of strategy and projections based on environmental changes.

### Operational Validation

Operational assumptions (customer traffic, average ticket, costs) should be **empirically validated** from the first months of operation. A system for monitoring key indicators will allow rapid identification of discrepancies and adjustment of forecasts.

### Contextual Adaptation

Using this study for other projects or locations requires **contextual adaptation** of assumptions and conclusions. Local specificities in terms of market, competition, and regulations must be systematically reassessed.
