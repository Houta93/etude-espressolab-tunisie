## Market Context and Opportunity

The study confirms that the Tunisian market is receptive to the Espressolab concept, with an adapted intermediate pricing strategy. The coffee sector, valued at **923.27 million USD** in 2025², is experiencing sustained annual growth of **8.72%**². This dynamic is driven by a predominantly urban population (70.88%)³ and a strong culture of out-of-home consumption (64% of the market)⁴.

Espressolab, an established Turkish brand with **390 establishments in 17 countries**⁵, positions itself in the *Third Wave Coffee* segment. Its business model has been adapted to the Tunisian market with an intermediate pricing strategy combining accessibility of basic products (espresso at 6.50 TND) and premium specialties, in a context of growing competition.

## Strategy and Performance

The strategy is based on an **optimal balance between volume and margin** (target of 280 customers/day) and an **intermediate pricing policy** (average ticket of 20.00 TND). This approach maintains the accessibility of basic products while enhancing premium specialties, creating a robust economic model.

The forecasts, based on realistic and balanced assumptions, demonstrate a rapid and attractive profitability trajectory, with a break-even point at 253 customers/day and a comfortable safety margin of 9.6%.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

The Espressolab Tunisia project represents a **viable and attractive investment opportunity**. The relevance of the concept for the local market is confirmed, with solid profitability based on a balanced intermediate pricing strategy.

**Recommendation: Proceed with the implementation of the project**, with rigorous monitoring of customer traffic, a cash reserve for the first two years, and an effective marketing strategy to reach the target of 280 customers/day.
