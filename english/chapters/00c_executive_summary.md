# Executive Summary

## An Investment Opportunity in Tunisia

This document summarizes the technical and economic feasibility study for establishing the **Espressolab** franchise in Tunisia. The project involves setting up an initial **250 m² flagship store** in Lac 2, Tunis, capitalizing on a growing coffee market and a "quality accessible" concept with strong potential.

The analysis demonstrates **conditional economic viability** and **moderate profitability**, supported by a volume-oriented operational model and a financial structure requiring **additional contributions in years 2 and 3**¹.

## Key Financial Indicators (Validated Final Data)

The following table presents the consolidated performance indicators that characterize the project.

| Indicator | Value | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Investment** | **2,224,910 TND**¹ | Flagship Store + Central Kitchen |
| **Revenue (Year 1)** | **1,764,000 TND**¹ | Based on 350 customers/day |
| **Average Ticket** | **14.00 TND**¹ | Very accessible positioning |
| **Gross Margin** | **62.5%**¹ | Performance in line with industry average |
| **Net Income (Year 5)** | **215,000 TND**¹ | Profitability from the fifth year |
| **IRR over 5 years** | **7.8%**¹ | Modest performance |
| **NPV (7%)** | **85,000 TND**¹ | Limited value creation |

## Market Context and Opportunity

The study confirms that the Tunisian market is receptive to the Espressolab concept, provided the pricing policy is adapted. The coffee sector, valued at **923.27 million USD** in 2025², is experiencing sustained annual growth of **8.72%**². This dynamic is driven by a predominantly urban population (70.88%)³ and a strong out-of-home consumption culture (64% of the market)⁴.

Espressolab, an established Turkish brand with **390 establishments in 17 countries**⁵, positions itself in the *Third Wave Coffee* segment. Its business model has been adapted to the Tunisian market with accessible prices (espresso at 6.50 TND) to attract a large volume of customers in a context of increasing competition.

## Strategy and Performance

The strategy is based on a **volume approach** (target of 350 customers/day) and an **accessible pricing policy** (beverages capped at 15 TND). This approach requires operational excellence to efficiently serve a high number of customers while maintaining quality.

The forecasts, based on realistic but demanding assumptions, demonstrate a slow but achievable profitability trajectory, with a break-even point at 318 customers/day and a limited safety margin of 9.1%.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

The Espressolab Tunisia project represents a **viable but risky investment opportunity**. The relevance of the concept for the local market is confirmed, but profitability heavily depends on achieving customer traffic targets.

**Recommendation: Proceed with project implementation under conditions**, with rigorous monitoring of customer traffic, a cash reserve for the first two years, and an effective marketing strategy to reach the target of 350 customers/day.
