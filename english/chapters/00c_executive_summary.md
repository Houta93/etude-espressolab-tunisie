# Executive Summary

## A Strategic Investment Opportunity in Tunisia

This document summarizes the technical and economic feasibility study for establishing the **Espressolab** franchise in Tunisia. The project involves setting up an initial **flagship store** of 250 m² at Lac 2 in Tunis, capitalizing on a rapidly expanding coffee market and a high-potential "accessible luxury" concept.

The analysis demonstrates **robust economic viability** and **exceptional profitability**, supported by a rigorous operational model and an optimized financial structure, financed **100% through equity**¹.

## Key Financial Indicators (Validated Final Data)

The following table presents the consolidated performance indicators that confirm the project's attractiveness.

| Indicator | Value | Comment |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Total Investment** | **2,224,910 TND**¹ | Flagship Store + Central Kitchen, 100% equity |
| **Revenue (Year 1)** | **2,250,000 TND**¹ | Based on 250 customers/day |
| **Average Ticket** | **25.00 TND**¹ | Accessible and attractive positioning |

| **NPV (10%)** | **685,000 TND**¹ | Significant value creation |

## Market Context and Opportunity

The study confirms that the Tunisian market is particularly receptive to the Espressolab concept. The coffee sector, valued at **923.27 million USD** in 2025², is experiencing sustained annual growth of **8.72%**². This dynamic is driven by a predominantly urban population (70.88%)³ and a strong culture of out-of-home consumption (64% of the market)⁴.

Espressolab, an established Turkish brand with **390 locations across 17 countries**⁵, positions itself in the growing *Third Wave Coffee* segment. Its business model, which combines a premium customer experience with controlled prices, perfectly meets the expectations of Tunisian consumers seeking novelty and quality, leaving significant room for growth in a market with less specialized competition.

## Strategy and Performance

The strategy is based on **operational excellence** (international standards, certified training) and a **solid financial structure**. The absence of bank debt eliminates financial charges and maximizes profitability from the first fiscal year.

The forecasts, based on realistic assumptions (250 customers/day, average ticket 25 TND)¹, demonstrate a healthy growth trajectory and significant value creation for the investor.

## Conclusion and Recommendation

The Espressolab Tunisia project represents a **first-class investment opportunity**. The soundness of the business model, the relevance of the concept for the local market, and the very positive financial indicators justify a rapid launch.

**Recommendation: Proceed immediately with project implementation** to capitalize on the first-mover advantage and the current market opportunity window.
