# Chapter 7: Financing Plan and Legal Structure

This chapter finalizes the study by detailing the project's financing strategy and the legal structure that will be established to support the business. It ensures consistency between the identified financial needs and mobilized resources, while optimizing the legal and tax framework in the specific context of the Tunisian market.

## 7.1 Financing Structure: A Mixed and Flexible Strategy

### 7.1.1 A Lever for Autonomy and Flexibility

The selected financing strategy combines the solidity of equity with the flexibility of a shareholder current account. This mixed approach secures the project while offering great management flexibility, particularly suited to the Tunisian economic context and the specificities of the restaurant sector.

The total project financing amounts to **2,224,910 TND (651,898 EUR)**, distributed as follows:

- **Share Capital**: **100,000 TND (29,300 EUR)**
- **Shareholder Current Account**: **2,124,910 TND (622,598 EUR)**

This structure offers several strategic advantages:

- **Administrative simplicity**: The share capital is set at a reasonable amount, simplifying incorporation formalities and reducing registration costs.
- **Financial flexibility**: The shareholder current account can be repaid flexibly, without the constraints of a bank loan (fixed installments, guarantees, etc.).
- **Decision-making autonomy**: The project is 100% financed by the sole shareholder, guaranteeing complete management autonomy and rapid execution.
- **Tax optimization**: Interest on the shareholder current account can be tax-deductible (within legal rate limits).
- **Adaptability**: Possibility to adjust the financing structure based on the project's actual performance.

### 7.1.2 Initial Financing Table

The following table details the balance between uses and sources of funds for the project launch:

| Uses | Amount (TND) | Amount (EUR) | Sources | Amount (TND) | Amount (EUR) |
| :--- | ---: | ---: | :--- | ---: | ---: |
| **Intangible Investments** | 250,000 | 73,250 | **Share Capital** | 100,000 | 29,300 |
| - Franchise rights | 250,000 | 73,250 | | | |
| **Tangible Investments** | 1,974,910 | 578,648 | **Shareholder Current Account** | 2,124,910 | 622,598 |
| - Flagship Store | 1,434,910 | 420,428 | | | |
| - Central Kitchen | 540,000 | 158,220 | | | |
| **Working Capital Requirement** | 0 | 0 | | | |
| **Total Uses** | **2,224,910** | **651,898** | **Total Sources** | **2,224,910** | **651,898** |

### 7.1.3 Additional Financing in Year 2

As identified in Chapter 6, additional financing of **400,000 TND (117,200 EUR)** will be necessary in Year 2 to support the opening of the first standard store. This financing will be provided through an increase in the shareholder current account, thus maintaining the project's financial flexibility.

### 7.1.4 Shareholder Current Account Repayment Schedule

A provisional repayment schedule for the shareholder current account has been established to ensure a balance between investor remuneration and preservation of the company's cash flow:

| Year | Repayment (TND) | Repayment (EUR) | Remaining Balance (TND) | Remaining Balance (EUR) |
| :---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | 0 | 0 | 2,124,910 | 622,598 |
| 2 | 0 | 0 | 2,524,910 | 739,798 |
| 3 | 200,000 | 58,600 | 2,324,910 | 681,198 |
| 4 | 400,000 | 117,200 | 1,924,910 | 563,998 |
| 5 | 600,000 | 175,800 | 1,324,910 | 388,198 |

This schedule takes into account the company's repayment capacity, which gradually increases with the expansion of the store network and improved profitability.

## 7.2 Legal Structure and Corporate Organization

### 7.2.1 Choice of Legal Form: SUARL

The optimal legal structure for the Espressolab Tunisia project is the **Single-Member Limited Liability Company (SUARL)**. This legal form combines the simplicity of managing an individual business with the asset protection of a capital company, which is perfectly suited to the Tunisian context and the specificities of the project.

#### Advantages of SUARL in the Tunisian context

1. **Limited liability**: The sole shareholder is liable for debts only up to the amount of their contributions, thus protecting their personal assets.
2. **Simplicity of incorporation**: Lighter administrative procedures than for a SA (public limited company).
3. **Management flexibility**: The sole shareholder can be the manager, simplifying decision-making.
4. **Commercial credibility**: Recognized structure facilitating relationships with partners and suppliers.
5. **Tax optimization**: Possibility to choose between corporate tax or income tax (option for IR).
6. **Scalability**: Possibility of transformation into a standard SARL if new shareholders join.

#### SUARL incorporation steps

1. **Drafting of articles of association**: Founding document defining the company's operating rules.
2. **Share capital deposit**: Payment of 100,000 TND into a blocked bank account.
3. **Tax registration**: Obtaining a tax ID and business license.
4. **Registration with the Commercial Register**: Formality conferring legal personality to the company.
5. **Publication in the Official Journal**: Legal announcement informing third parties of the company's creation.

The total cost of these formalities is estimated at **3,500 TND (1,026 EUR)**, including the fees of a lawyer specialized in business law.

### 7.2.2 Franchise Agreement

The franchise agreement with Espressolab is at the heart of the legal structure. It defines the rights and obligations of each party and frames the long-term collaboration. Key clauses include:

#### Fundamental elements of the agreement

- **Duration**: 5 years, renewable by tacit renewal
- **Territorial exclusivity**: By city, with a protection radius of 1.5 km around each point of sale
- **Royalties**: 6% of net revenue, payable monthly
- **Entry fee**: 250,000 TND (73,250 EUR) for national exclusivity
- **Franchisor obligations**:
  - Provision of know-how and operational methods
  - Initial and ongoing team training
  - Technical and commercial assistance
  - Access to recipes and procedures
  - Marketing and communication support
  - Access to the international supply network
- **Franchisee obligations**:
  - Compliance with brand standards and concept
  - Exclusive supply for certain strategic products
  - Participation in national and international marketing campaigns
  - Compliance with quality and hygiene standards
  - Regular transmission of sales and performance data
  - Contribution to the international marketing fund (1% of revenue)

#### Specific clauses negotiated for the Tunisian market

- **Local adaptation**: Possibility to adapt 20% of the menu to the specificities of the Tunisian market
- **Local sourcing**: Authorization to source certain non-strategic ingredients locally
- **Enhanced training**: Specific training program for Tunisian staff
- **Pricing flexibility**: Freedom to set prices within a range of Â±15% compared to the franchisor's recommendations
- **Development clause**: Commitment to open 5 points of sale over 5 years

### 7.2.3 Organizational Structure and Governance

The governance of the SUARL will be structured to ensure operational efficiency and strategic control:

- **Management**: Provided by the sole shareholder, with delegation of powers to the general manager
- **Management committee**: Monthly meeting bringing together the manager, the general manager, and department heads
- **Advisory board**: Composed of external experts (finance, marketing, restaurant industry) meeting quarterly to provide an outside perspective on strategy

A detailed organizational chart is presented in Chapter 5 (Organization and Human Resources).

## 7.3 Tax Aspects and Optimization

### 7.3.1 Applicable Tax Regime

The SUARL will be subject to **Corporate Tax (IS)** at the normal rate of 15% in force in Tunisia. This choice is motivated by the project's growth and profitability prospects, as well as the possibility of carrying forward losses from the first years.

#### Tax advantages applicable to the project

1. **Depreciation deduction**: Straight-line depreciation over 5 years for tangible and intangible investments
2. **Interest deduction**: Deductibility of interest on shareholder current account (within the legal rate limit)
3. **Loss carryforward**: Possibility to carry forward losses from the first years to future profits
4. **FIPA advantages**: Partial exemption for exporting companies (applicable if international development)
5. **Investment incentives**: Tax reductions for investments in certain regional development zones

### 7.3.2 Dividend Distribution Policy

The dividend distribution policy will be prudent in the first years to favor self-financing of growth. It is recommended not to distribute dividends before Year 3, in order to consolidate cash flow and finance the opening of new stores.

#### Provisional distribution plan

| Year | Net Income (TND) | Net Income (EUR) | Distribution (%) | Dividends (TND) | Dividends (EUR) |
| :---: | ---: | ---: | :---: | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | -328,000 | -96,104 | 0% | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | -84,000 | -24,612 | 0% | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 250,000 | 73,250 | 20% | 50,000 | 14,650 |
| 4 | 638,000 | 186,934 | 30% | 191,400 | 56,080 |
| 5 | 1,096,000 | 321,128 | 40% | 438,400 | 128,451 |

This progressive policy allows:
- Strengthening the company's equity
- Financing organic growth without excessive debt
- Ensuring a reasonable return on investment from Year 3
- Maintaining sufficient cash flow to deal with contingencies

### 7.3.3 VAT Optimization

Optimal VAT management is an important issue for the project's profitability:

- **Collected VAT**: 7% on food products, 19% on non-alcoholic beverages
- **Deductible VAT**: On investments, purchases, and external expenses
- **VAT credit**: Particularly important during the initial investment phase

Rigorous monitoring of VAT declarations and refunds will be implemented to optimize cash flow.
