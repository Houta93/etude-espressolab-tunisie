# Chapter 7: Financing Plan and Legal Structure

This chapter finalizes the study by detailing the project's financing strategy and the legal structure that will be established to support the business. It ensures consistency between the identified financial needs and mobilized resources, while optimizing the legal and tax framework.

## 7.1 Financing Structure: A Mixed and Flexible Strategy

### 7.1.1 A Lever for Autonomy and Flexibility

The selected financing strategy combines the solidity of equity with the flexibility of a shareholder current account. This mixed approach allows for securing the project while offering great management flexibility.

The total financing of the project amounts to **2,224,910 TND**, distributed as follows:

- **Share Capital**: **100,000 TND**
- **Shareholder Current Account**: **2,124,910 TND**

This structure presents several advantages:

- **Simplicity**: The share capital is set at a reasonable amount, which simplifies the incorporation formalities.
- **Flexibility**: The shareholder current account can be repaid flexibly, without the constraints of a bank loan.
- **Autonomy**: The project is 100% financed by the sole shareholder, which guarantees total management autonomy.

| Uses | Amount (TND) | Sources | Amount (TND) |

## 7.2 Legal Structure and Corporate Framework

### 7.2.1 Choice of Legal Form: SUARL

The optimal legal structure for the Espressolab Tunisia project is the **Single-Member Limited Liability Company (SUARL)**. This legal form combines the management simplicity of an individual enterprise with the asset protection of a capital company, which is perfectly adapted to the Tunisian context and the specificities of the project.

### 7.2.2 Franchise Agreement

The franchise agreement with Espressolab is at the heart of the legal structure. It defines the rights and obligations of each party and frames the long-term collaboration. The key clauses of the contract include:

- **Duration**: 5 years, renewable
- **Exclusivity**: Territorial (by city)
- **Royalties**: 6% of net revenue
- **Franchisor obligations**: Provision of know-how, technical assistance, training, etc.
- **Franchisee obligations**: Compliance with brand standards, exclusive supply, etc.

## 7.3 Tax Aspects and Optimization

The SUARL will be subject to **Corporate Income Tax (IS)** at the normal rate in force in Tunisia. The tax strategy will aim to optimize the tax burden in compliance with legislation.

### 7.3.1 Dividend Distribution Policy

The dividend distribution policy will be prudent in the first years to favor self-financing of growth. It is recommended not to distribute dividends before year 3, in order to consolidate cash flow and finance the opening of new stores.

## 7.4 Risk Management and Insurance

### 7.4.1 Risk Identification and Assessment

The main identified risks are operational, financial, and legal in nature.

### 7.4.2 Mitigation Strategies and Coverage

For each risk, a mitigation strategy is put in place, combining prevention, protection, and transfer.

### 7.4.3 Comprehensive Insurance Program

A robust insurance program is essential to protect the investment. The annual cost is estimated at **9,600 TND**, integrated into the forecast expenses.
