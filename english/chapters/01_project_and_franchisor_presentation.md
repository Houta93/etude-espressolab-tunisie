## 1.2 The Franchisor: Espressolab

This section presents in detail the franchisor Espressolab, a major and innovative player in the international specialty coffee market.

### 1.2.1 Brand Identity and Vision

#### Genesis and Mission

Founded in 2014 by Turkish entrepreneur Esat Kocadaƒü, Espressolab was born from a vision: to democratize specialty coffee by making it accessible to as many people as possible¬π. The adventure began at Bilgi University in Istanbul in a 17.6 m¬≤ space, reflecting the desire to create a young and dynamic ecosystem around a quality coffee culture¬≤.

The company's mission is to **merge the rich Turkish coffee culture with international quality standards**, adopting a "farm-to-cup" approach that guarantees consistent traceability and excellence¬≥.

#### Core Values

Espressolab's success is based on three cardinal values:

- **Quality and Excellence**: Direct sourcing from producers in Ethiopia, Brazil, and Kenya ensures high-quality beans and fair trade‚Å¥.
- **Innovation and Differentiation**: The company distinguishes itself through patented technologies such as **Therma-Freeze Coffee** (preserving beans at -30¬∞C) and by being the first coffee chain in the world to produce its own milk at its farm in Kƒ±rklareli‚Åµ.
- **Sustainability and Responsibility**: Through its "Future Generation of Coffee" program, Espressolab is committed to regenerative agriculture and the circular economy, for example by transforming coffee grounds into eco-friendly products‚Å∂.

### 1.2.2 Concept and Strategic Positioning

#### The "Third Wave Coffee" Movement

Espressolab is fully aligned with the **third wave of coffee** (*Third Wave Coffee*), a movement that treats coffee as an exceptional artisanal product, similar to wine or gastronomy‚Å∑. This philosophy translates into expertise at every step, from terroir selection to extraction method, and advanced barista training.

#### Customer Experience at the Heart of the Concept

Architecture and design of sales points are a pillar of the strategy. Far from being simple caf√©s, the establishments are designed as **living spaces and cultural centers**. The most striking example is the **Espressolab Roastery** in Istanbul, Europe's largest coffee experience center at 6,000 m¬≤, which hosts workshops, concerts, and artistic events, attracting more than 10,000 visitors per day‚Å∏.

### 1.2.3 International Expansion and Ambitions

#### Exceptional Growth

In a decade, Espressolab has experienced meteoric growth, evolving from a single caf√© to an international network. This rapid expansion testifies to the relevance of its business model and its adaptability.

### 1.2.4 The Franchise Business Model

Espressolab's development is largely based on a franchise model, with **93% of the network operated by franchised partners**¬π¬≥. This model allows for rapid expansion while relying on the expertise and commitment of local entrepreneurs.
