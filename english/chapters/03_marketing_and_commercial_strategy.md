# Chapter 3: Marketing and Commercial Strategy

## 3.1 Strategic Positioning

### 3.1.1 Positioning Definition

Espressolab's positioning in Tunisia is that of **"accessible luxury"**, offering an international specialty coffee experience at a price tailored for the Tunisian upper middle class. The differentiation is achieved through **product quality** (Third Wave Coffee), **customer experience** (design, service), and the **first-mover advantage** in this segment.

### 3.1.2 Competitive Positioning Analysis

The table below positions Espressolab in relation to the main players in the Tunisian coffee market:

| Criterion | Espressolab | Traditional Cafés | International Chains | Hotel Cafés |
