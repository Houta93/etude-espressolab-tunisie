# Chapter 3: Marketing and Commercial Strategy

*Revised and enriched version in progress...*

## 3.1 Strategic Positioning (Summary)

Espressolab's positioning in Tunisia is that of **"accessible luxury"**, offering an international specialty coffee experience at a price designed for the Tunisian upper middle class. Differentiation is achieved through **product quality** (Third Wave Coffee), **customer experience** (design, service), and the **first-mover advantage** in this segment.

## 3.2 Segmentation and Targeting (Summary)

The strategy targets three main personas:
1. **"The Trendy Student"** (18-25 years): Looking for a place to socialize and work.
2. **"The Young Active Professional"** (25-35 years): Looking for a premium setting for breaks and meetings.
3. **"The Expatriate / Tourist"** (30-50 years): Looking for international standards.

## 3.3 Operational Marketing Mix (4Ps)

### 3.3.1 Product Policy

The offering is structured around three levels:
- **The core product**: A range of specialty coffees (espresso, lattes, cold brew) prepared according to international standards, with high-quality beans sourced directly by the brand.
- **The tangible product**: A complementary offering of fine pastries, healthy snacks, and merchandising (cups, coffee beans) that reinforces the brand image and increases the average ticket.
- **The augmented product**: The overall customer experience, including careful interior design, curated musical ambiance, impeccable customer service, and high-performance Wi-Fi.

### 3.3.2 Price Policy

The pricing strategy is **adapted skimming**, aiming to position the brand as premium but accessible.
- **Beverage prices**: Between 8 and 15 TND, a positioning significantly higher than traditional caf√©s (2-4 TND) but lower than luxury hotels (20-25 TND).
- **Value justification**: The price is justified by the superior quality of ingredients, barista expertise, setting, and overall experience.
- **Launch offers**: Discovery offers and loyalty programs will be implemented to encourage trial and create an initial customer base.

### 3.3.3 Place Policy

The distribution strategy is **exclusive and direct**, focused on strategic locations to maximize visibility and accessibility for the target clientele.
- **Priority locations**: The choice will focus on high-traffic areas with high image value such as business districts (Lac 2), upscale residential areas (La Marsa), and premium shopping centers (Tunis City).
- **Sales channels**:
    - **On-site sales**: The main channel, centered on the in-store experience.
    - **Click & Collect**: Will allow customers to order online and pick up their order quickly, meeting the needs of busy professional clientele.
    - **Delivery via partners**: A partnership with local delivery platforms (such as Glovo) will be considered after the launch phase to reach a wider clientele.

### 3.3.4 Promotion Policy

The communication strategy is 100% digital, aggressive, and targeted at the identified personas.
- **Phase 1: Teasing (D-30 to D-1)**: Creation of social media accounts (Instagram, Facebook, TikTok) with high-quality visual content, highlighting the brand's aesthetics and the mystery of its arrival. Collaboration with a selection of "lifestyle" influencers to announce the imminent opening.
- **Phase 2: Launch (D-0 to D+30)**: Private inauguration event with press and influencers. Geolocated paid advertising campaigns on social networks to reach the target clientele in catchment areas. Organization of tastings and workshops to showcase coffee quality.
- **Phase 3: Awareness (After D+30)**: Content marketing focused on specialty coffee education (blog articles, videos). Referral and loyalty program to encourage word-of-mouth. Partnerships with companies and coworking spaces for corporate offers.
