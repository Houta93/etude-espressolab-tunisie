# Chapter 2: In-Depth Market Study in Tunisia

## 2.1 Macroeconomic and Demographic Context

### 2.1.1 Macroeconomic Situation: A Fragile but Real Recovery

Tunisia is experiencing a **moderate but steady economic recovery**, creating a favorable environment for investment. After growth of 2.7% in 2022, the economy grew by **1.4% in 2024**, and World Bank forecasts project an acceleration to **1.9% in 2025**¹. This dynamic is mainly driven by the **recovery of the tourism sector** (+8.3% in revenue in 2024) and the **increase in remittances** from Tunisians abroad (+11.2%)¹.

However, structural challenges remain. **Public debt**, although controlled, remains high at **81.2% of GDP in 2024**¹. **Inflation**, although down to **5.9% in March 2025**, continues to affect purchasing power, particularly for food products (food inflation at 7.8%)¹.

| Macroeconomic Indicator | Value (2024) | Trend | Reliable Source |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **GDP Growth** | **+1.4%** | Moderate increase | World Bank¹ |
| **Public Debt** | **81.2% of GDP** | Stable but high | World Bank¹ |
| **Inflation (March 2025)** | **5.9%** | Decreasing | World Bank¹ |
| **Unemployment Rate (Q3 2024)** | **16.0%** | Slight increase | World Bank¹ |

### 2.1.2 Demographics and Urbanization: A Concentrated and Accessible Market

With a population of **12.36 million inhabitants in 2025**², Tunisia presents a human-sized market, but with a **very favorable urban concentration** for our project. Indeed, **70.88% of the population lives in cities**³, mainly in large coastal urban areas.

This high urbanization is a major asset, as it concentrates potential customers in restricted and easily accessible geographical areas. The urban hierarchy is clear:

- **Greater Tunis**: More than one million inhabitants, economic and political heart.
- **Sfax**: 277,278 inhabitants, main economic center of the central region.
- **Sousse**: 164,123 inhabitants, major tourist and industrial hub.

### 2.1.3 Purchasing Power and Social Classes: The Emergence of a Target Clientele

Tunisia is distinguished by the **predominance of a large middle class**, which represents nearly **90% of the population** according to the African Development Bank⁴. This middle class, although having less purchasing power than European standards, is increasingly **demanding quality products and consumption experiences**.

The **average monthly income** is between **1,362 TND (400€) and 2,009 TND (590€)** for the middle and upper classes⁵. This income level, combined with a **GDP per capita of 4,530 USD in 2024**¹, is sufficient to allow regular spending in premium restaurant concepts like Espressolab.

## 2.2 Strategic Environmental Analysis (PESTEL)

The PESTEL analysis identifies macro-environmental factors that can influence the Espressolab project in Tunisia.

| Factor | Analysis of Influences on the Espressolab Project |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Political** | **Stability in Transition**: Tunisia is experiencing a phase of political stabilization. The current government favors foreign investments to revive the economy, which represents an **opportunity**. However, sporadic social tensions can create a climate of uncertainty (moderate threat). |
| **Economic** | **Recovery and Inflation**: Moderate economic growth (opportunity) is counterbalanced by inflation that weighs on purchasing power (threat). Dependence on tourism and remittances makes the economy sensitive to external shocks. The strong concentration of the middle class is a **major opportunity**. |
| **Social** | **Coffee Culture and Westernization**: The strong coffee culture and socialization in public places are **fundamental assets**. The growing interest in international brands and westernized consumption experiences represents a **very favorable underlying trend** for Espressolab. |
| **Technological** | **Digitalization and Marketing**: The rapid adoption of smartphones and social networks (more than 8 million Facebook users) offers **exceptional marketing opportunities** to target urban and young customers. Mobile payment is developing, which could simplify operations in the future. |
| **Ecological** | **Sensitivity to Sustainability**: An ecological awareness is emerging among urban consumers. Espressolab's "farm-to-cup" approach and sustainable sourcing practices can become a **competitive advantage and a strong marketing argument**. Waste and water management will be an operational vigilance point. |
| **Legal** | **Favorable but Complex Regulations**: Tunisian business regulations are being modernized to attract investments. However, administrative procedures can be lengthy and complex (moderate threat). Labor law is protective for employees, which implies labor costs that need to be well anticipated. |

## 2.3 Competitive Forces Analysis (Porter)

Porter's 5 forces analysis allows us to evaluate the attractiveness of the Tunisian specialty coffee market.

| Competitive Force | Intensity | Analysis for Espressolab |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Threat of New Entrants** | **High** | Entry barriers for a traditional café are low (low initial investment). However, for a specialty coffee concept with international standards like Espressolab, barriers are higher (investment, know-how, supply chain). The main threat would come from other international chains. **The first-mover advantage is therefore crucial.** |
| **Bargaining Power of Suppliers** | **Low** | Espressolab controls its supply chain by directly importing its green coffee. For other raw materials (milk, sugar, etc.), local supply is abundant and not concentrated, which limits supplier power. |
| **Bargaining Power of Customers** | **Medium** | Customers have a choice between many traditional low-price cafés. However, for Espressolab's target clientele (urban, middle and upper class), the specialty coffee offering is very limited. The innovative character and differentiated customer experience of Espressolab will reduce customers' bargaining power. |
| **Threat of Substitute Products** | **Medium** | Substitute products include tea, sodas, and home coffee consumption. The strong coffee culture in Tunisia and the social dimension of its consumption limit this threat. The main substitution remains home-brewed coffee, but it does not meet the need for socialization. |
| **Intensity of Competitive Rivalry** | **Low (in the premium segment)** | Rivalry is **extremely strong** in the traditional café market, with intense price competition. However, in the specialty coffee segment, competition is **almost non-existent**. Espressolab would be in a quasi-monopoly position at launch, with only a few small independent players. |

**Conclusion of Porter's analysis:** The specialty coffee market in Tunisia is **very attractive**. The low competitive intensity in the premium segment, combined with limited bargaining power of suppliers and customers (for the specialty offering), creates an **exceptional window of opportunity** for Espressolab.

## 2.4 Detailed Coffee Market Analysis

### 2.4.1 Market Size and Structure: Potential to Confirm

The Tunisian coffee market is estimated at **923 million dollars in 2024** by Euromonitor International⁶. This figure encompasses both at-home and out-of-home consumption. The structure of this market is particularly interesting for our project:

- **Out-of-Home Consumption**: Represents **64% of the market value**, or approximately **590 million dollars**⁶. This confirms the strong culture of socialization around coffee in Tunisia.
- **At-Home Consumption**: Represents **36% of the market value**, or approximately **333 million dollars**⁶.

Annual consumption per capita is estimated at **3.6 kg**, a figure comparable to many European countries, which testifies to the importance of coffee in Tunisians' daily lives⁷.

**Missing data identified:**
- **Specific size of the "specialty coffee" segment in Tunisia.** This figure is probably low, but an estimate, even approximate, would be a plus. I will launch a targeted search on this point.

### 2.4.2 Key Trends: Premiumization in Progress

Several underlying trends support Espressolab's potential:

- **Premiumization**: Tunisian consumers, especially urban youth, are increasingly turning to better quality products and are willing to pay more for a differentiated experience⁸.
- **Interest in novelty**: There is a strong demand for new concepts and new flavors, particularly espresso-based drinks (latte, cappuccino) and alternative preparation methods (cold brew)⁹.
- **Digitalization of habits**: The use of social networks to discover new places and share experiences has become a reflex for the target clientele.

### 2.4.3 Growth Dynamics: Quality-Driven Expansion

The coffee market in Tunisia is expected to experience a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of **8.72% in value between 2025 and 2030**⁶. It is important to note that volume growth is much lower (+0.9% forecast for 2026)⁶. This means that market growth is almost exclusively driven by **rising average prices**, confirming the trend towards premiumization.

Following a targeted search, there is no precise public data on the size of the "specialty coffee" segment in Tunisia, which confirms its emerging character. Based on similar markets, it can be estimated at **less than 2% of the total out-of-home coffee market**, representing a potential market of **10 to 12 million dollars**. This segment is in the creation phase and therefore presents the highest growth potential.
